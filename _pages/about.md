Hi! I am Nishanth,  a Master of Science student in **Robotics Engineering** at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) working in the [Perception and Autonomous Robotics (PeAR)](https://pear.wpi.edu/) Lab with [Prof. Nitin Sanket](https://nitinjsanket.github.io/about.html) and [Prof. Connor McCann](https://wp.wpi.edu/prismlab/). My work focuses on co-optimizing the mechanical design and control strategies of a drone shell to improve how a quadcopter orients itself before and after impact. This enables stable, high-speed traversal through dense forests for search-and-rescue missions, allowing drones to safely bounce off obstacles instead of crashing. 

Before joining WPI, I worked in the [Manipulators Robotics Group](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~robotics_lab/pr.html) at Robotics Lab, IIT Madras with [Prof. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/) on the design and analysis of parallel manipulators, including analytical geometric modeling, constraint formulation, real-time collision detection, and path planning for multi-DOF robotic systems. My work and research interests span perception, geometric modeling, vision-based robotic manipulation, and motion planning.
